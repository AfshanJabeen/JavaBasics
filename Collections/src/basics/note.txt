Collection Interface -> List Interface -> 1. ArrayList Class 2. LinkedList Class
Collection c= new ArrayList(); //accepts object -> object is a base class for all the classes in java
c.add(1)
c.add("Afshan")

Similarly for List
List l = new ArrayList();
l.add(1);
l.add("Afshan")

Java is type safe language -> for any variable to be used, first the variable type should be declared
but in above 2 codes, type safety is not achieved and it can achieved using generics (e.g. <Integer>)
Generics works only with classes (Integer is a class, it works but not for int)
