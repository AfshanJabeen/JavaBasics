Collections class provides static methods for sorting the elements of collections. 
If collection elements are of Set or Map, we can use TreeSet or TreeMap. 
However, we cannot sort the elements of List. Collections class provides methods for sorting the elements of List type elements.

public void sort(List list): It is used to sort the elements of List. List elements must be of the Comparable type.

Note: String class and Wrapper classes implement the Comparable interface by default.
 So if you store the objects of string or wrapper classes in a list, set or map, it will be Comparable by default.
 
 TreeMap sort elements by Key, to sort by value we use the comparator interface
